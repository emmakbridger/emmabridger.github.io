Hello! I am a Senior Research Fellow in [Psychology](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/social-sciences/about-us/staff/psychology), at [Birmingham City University](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/). My background is in experimental psychology and memory although my research interests now cover a very broad range of behavioural science topics. 

Many of my current interests lie at the intersection between well-being, health, socioeconomic inequality and social psychology. I am particularly interested in thinking about new ways in which behavioural science can contribute to academic study of inequality and social issues. 

But that's not all I'm up to - I spend a lot of time thinking about how to both teach and apply ethics and open science principles. Do have a look around to see more, check out research activities and pre-registrations at [osf.io/gmz9h](https://osf.io/gmz9h) or get in touch with me directly at emma[dot]bridger[at]bcu[dot]ac[dot]uk.
