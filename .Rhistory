Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my website. I am a Senior Research Fellow in [Psychology](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/social-sciences/about-us/staff/psychology), at [Birmingham City University](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/).
My research interests span across areas of both social and cognitive psychology. I am particularly interested in how the behavioural and social sciences can contribute to understanding of determinants of well-being as well as public understanding of inequality. I use a combination of both primary and secondary data, as well as cross-sectional and experimental designs.
material & psychosocial -> health and wellbeing
In particular I am interested in:
* Perceptions of socioeconomic health inequality
* Attributions of health and health inequality
* Lots more stuff to go in here
Feel free to have a look around to learn more about me and my research interests or get in touch with me directly at emma[dot]bridger[at]bcu[dot]ac[dot]uk

My background is in experimental psychology and memory although my research interests now cover a very broad range of behavioural science topics. Much of my current interests lie at the intersection between well-being, health, socioeconomic inequality and social psychology. I am particularly interested in how (or even whether!) behavioural science can usefully contribute to public understanding of how the impact of
