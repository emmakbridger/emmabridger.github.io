Some of my current research projects include:

*A new approach to documenting public opinion of health inequalities in the United Kingdom and United States* 

This project is funded by a BA/Leverhulme Small Research grant. It began in December 2020 and employs a number of different methods to capture views of the UK and US public on health inequality. Part of this includes the use of a novel objective and easy-to-interpret measure of the public's perceived and desired levels of health inequality. Access the pre-print from the first part of the project [here](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202206.0215/v1).

*Perceptions of universal basic income as a population mental health intervention*

This project is aligned to my broader interests in public intuitions and attributions about macro-social and population level interventions. Accepted pre-print is accessible [here](https://psyarxiv.com/w6ae8).

*Testing the social cognitive model of gratitude and pay for essential workers*

This project tests whether a model of state and trait gratitude can be used to predict responses towards essential workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular, how much they should be paid.
